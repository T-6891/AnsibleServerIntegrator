# Ansible Server Automation Script

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script designed to automate the process of adding new servers to an Ansible inventory. The script streamlines the setup and integration of servers, making it easy to manage and deploy configurations in a scalable manner.

## Features

- **SSH Connection**: Automates the process of connecting to new servers using SSH.
- **Ansible User Setup**: Creates an Ansible user account on the new server and adds it to the sudoers file.
- **SSH Key Management**: Handles the addition of public SSH keys to the new server for secure, passwordless authentication.
- **Ansible Inventory Update**: Automatically updates the Ansible inventory with the new server's details.
- **Known Hosts Management**: Adds the new server to the list of known hosts, aiding in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Ansible Ping Check**: Verifies the connection and accessibility of the new server via Ansible's ping module.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Paramiko (for SSH connections)
- Access to the new servers with sufficient privileges
- An existing Ansible setup

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. Navigate to the script directory:
   ```bash
   cd [script-directory]
   ```
3. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
